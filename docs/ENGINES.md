# Catalogue engines (Koma)

Koma does **not** load Mihon/Tachiyomi extension APKs or arbitrary DEX at runtime.
The unit of value is a **first-party platform engine** (Kotlin). JSON files are only
**packs** that clone a supported family without new code.

## Model

| Layer | What it is | How it arrives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Platform engine** | Kotlin adapter (`MadaraEngine`, `MangaDexEngine`, …) | App update |
| **Family pack** | JSON with `engine` = `madara` / `libsocial` / `hivetoons` | Bundled assets or URL import |
| **Site engine** | One-site Kotlin adapter (`weebcentral`, `demonic`) | App update only (not importable) |
| **Local** | Folders / CBZ | Always built-in |

```
JSON pack ──► SourceRegistry ──► known engine id ──► Kotlin class
                    │
                    └── unknown / non-family import ──► rejected
```

## Core platform engines

| Engine id | Role | Packs? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mangadex` | MangaDex API | no (identity manifest only) |
| `libsocial` | cdnlibs (MangaLib family) | yes (`siteId`, `apiBase`) |
| `madara` | WordPress Madara theme | yes (`baseUrl`, paths, ajax) |
| `hivetoons` | Iken-style API | yes (`baseUrl`, `apiBase`) |
| `mangakatana` | MangaKatana HTML | no |
| `asura` | Asura API | no |
| `remanga` | ReManga API | no |
| `mangabuff` | MangaBuff HTML | no |
| `local` | Offline folders/CBZ | no |

## Bundled sources (assets)

| ID | Engine | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mangadex` | `mangadex` | Core |
| `mangakatana` | `mangakatana` | Core HTML |
| `asura` | `asura` | Core API |
| `mangalib` / `yaoilib` / `hentailib` | `libsocial` | Family packs (`siteId`) |
| `mangaread` | `madara` | Family pack example |
| `hivetoons` / `vortexscans` | `hivetoons` | Family packs |
| `remanga` | `remanga` | Russian API |
| `mangabuff` | `mangabuff` | Russian HTML |
| `local` | `local` | Injected in code |

Optional Madara mirrors (Cloudflare-prone) live under [`packs/madara`](packs/madara/likemanga.json) — import via Sources UI if needed.

LibSocial sources support **in-app login** (WebView → `localStorage.auth`) from the Sources screen.

One-site engines (`weebcentral`, `demonic`) remain in the binary for compatibility but are **not** in default assets and **cannot** be imported as JSON. Sample manifests: [`packs/site`](packs/site/weebcentral.json).

**Not bundled yet:** InkStory (opaque SPA API), Com-X.life (antibot gate) — need more reverse-engineering.

## Import rules

`SourceRegistry.importJson` / `importUrl` accept only:

- `engine`: `madara` | `libsocial` | `hivetoons`

Anything else fails with a clear message: new engines ship with the app.

## ExtensionLoader

**Out of scope.** Reasons: security / Play policy, API drift, licensing, native stack.
